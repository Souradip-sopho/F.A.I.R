# First Autonomous Intelligent Robot

There are two sub-projects under fair : 



1. Plane Segmentation on FAIR-  Interfacing Kinect2.0 with with ROS to get Point Cloud Data. 
The task was to display normal vector arrows of the planes in the same colour as the points belonging to the plane. 
To visualize the incoming data I used ROS visualization tool (RVIZ).
Normal vector was found by finding the equation of the plane . 


2. Communication through ROS - 
Designing a controller to drive a robot(FAIR) with High Torque Encoder DC Servo Motor 300 RPM drive through I2C communication
using a Arduino. Then the task is to convert joystick commands into motor commands and control motion of the robot.
The controller and the joystick was interfaced with the laptop using ROS Indigo.
